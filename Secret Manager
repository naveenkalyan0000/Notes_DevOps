system manager :
its for less secure things like docker username and registry url
secrets manager:
its for high secure things like passwords,tokens, for database
you have additional features like you can rotate (or change) like password for every few days or months
it is costly than systems manager 
we generally use both of these combinations for example less secure thing like docker username with systems manager and for docker password we use secrets manger
but these two are fixed for one particular cloud like only AWS
hashicorp vault:
widely used and it is open source 
it can be used with any cloud 
you have lot of additional features like encryption,etc., than before two
